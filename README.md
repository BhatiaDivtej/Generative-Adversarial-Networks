The generator and the discriminator have different training processes. The alter training strategy is utilized for training both the generator and discriminator separately.

The generator trains for one or more iterations. We keep the discriminator constant during the generator training phase.
The discriminator trains for one or more iterations. We keep the generator constant during the discriminator training phase.
